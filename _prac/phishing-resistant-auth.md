# Objective

GSA Office of Government-wide Policy Office of Technology Policy Identity Assurance and
Trusted Access Division is establishing a product criteria and vetting process to accelerate
federal adoption of phishing-resistant authenticators across federal agencies. This process
leverages a combination of independent certification bodies, third party audit organization, and
testing facilities aligned with the NIST 800-63 digital identity guidelines to ensure interoperability,
security, and resiliency in support of federal mandates to move toward using passwordless
authentication.

# Summary

Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Memorandum M-22-09 Federal Zero Trust Strategy
dated January 26, 2022, encourages federal agencies to pursue greater use of phishing
resistant multi-factor authenticators as they modernize their agency-managed identity systems.

This includes:

- Identifying methods to leverage passwordless authenticators.
- Replacing memorized secrets with a minimum phishing-resistant alternative such as FIDO2/WebAuthn.

Enterprisewide implementation should support centralized management of these authentication
methods connected to current identity management systems. Agencies are encouraged to
procure phishing-resistant authenticators that meet third-party standards aligned with NIST
800-63 guidelines relating to digital identity security, interoperability and resiliency.

# Scope

The scope of this product list is to leverage third-party certification and testing organizations to
identify phishing-resistant authenticators that meet NIST 800-63 standards.. The criteria is
scoped to work as an accelerator to guide federal agencies in adopting phishing-resistant
authenticators as they modernize their identity management systems.. The first set of third-party
testing and standards organizations to be recognized includes Fast Identity Online and the Kantara Initiative.

# Process overview
The GSA IATAD will use existing resources to verify vendor submissions. The anticipated effort
is low based on an initial vendor market review.

1. Application – The application is posted on idmanagement.gov and manually submitted to
the IATAD through the [icam@gsa.gov](mailto:icam@gsa.gov) email. The vendor enters into an agreement with
GSA based on the FIPS 201 Evaluation Program Vendor Agreement outlining roles and
responsibilities for product listing, however, third-party criteria will be used for vetting.

2. Processing – Applications are processed on the first of every month and monthly
updates will be provided. The schedule is adjusted based on volume of submissions or
other factors.

3. Review process – The application is assigned a product list number for tracking, and the
application is verified that it contains all necessary information and links to validate a
vendor’s compliance with an external certification body.

4. Decision – If all information is verified and validated, the vendor and product are listed on
the product list available at [idmanagement.gov/buy/#products](https://www.idmanagement.gov/buy/#products){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}.

5. Maintenance – Vendors are required to provide timely updates with changes within their
product certification. GSA IATAD team reviews and validates product submissions on a
quarterly basis.

6. Removal – If a vendor fails to provide accurate information or an issue is found that
brings into question the security and resiliency, the product is moved to the [Removed Product List](https://www.idmanagement.gov/buy/removed-products-list/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} and the community is notified of its removal through idmanagement.gov,
ICAMSC, and Digital identity Community of Practice, as well as federal acquisition
channels.

Part of this process also includes recognizing external certification and testing processes. These
bodies include Fast Identity Online Alliance and the Kantara Initiative, but others may be used
and assessed as identified by either agencies or vendors. Formal organizations will sign an
agreement with GSA, recognizing their roles and responsibilities, their conformance schema,
and testing processes, as well as GSA’s participation or interaction with the entity.

# Product list criteria

The questionnaire is intended to provide a consistent and standard way to receive feedback
These questions are to be used for initial vetting of vendor products to achieve interoperability,
security, and reliability assurances. The questionnaire collects input on the security compliance
status of proposed products based on federal guidelines such as external body conformance
testing and certification to NIST 800-63, FIPS 140 certification, and supply chain security.
Vendors are encouraged to complete the questionnaire to the maximum extent possible and
provide artifacts to validate their inputs.

Once approved, the product will be listed on [idmanagement.gov](https://www.idmanagement.gov){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} and shared through federal
security and acquisition communities.

# Conclusion

Phishing-resistant product vetting criteria will help accelerate federal government adoption and
support OMB Memo 22-09 objectives. This criteria intent is to leverage third-party certification
bodies and testing processes that conform or align to NIST 800–63-3 standards. Such
organizations include the FIDO Alliance and the Kantara Initiative.
