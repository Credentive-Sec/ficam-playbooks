# Introduction

Digital identity represents each individual engaged in an online transaction. However, an individual’s real-life identity may not be known when used to access a digital service (a digital service is any federal Information Technology (IT) system or application accessible over the public internet or agency intranet). Identity proofing helps establish that the individual is who they claim to be. Digital authentication provides reasonable risk-based assurances that the individual accessing the application is the same individual who previously accessed the service.  This playbook is a method to apply the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800-63-3 Digital Identity Guidelines.  Federal agencies can perform a Digital Identity Risk Assessment (DIRA) to determine the appropriate identity, authenticator, or federation level outlined to access an application. A DIRA is a method of applying Digital Identity Risk Management required by OMB Memorandum 19-17: Enabling Mission Delivery through Improved Identity, Credential, and Access Management, and NIST Special Publication 800-63-3 Digital Identity Guidelines.

## Purpose

Most federal agencies offer services through an IT system or application, such as a website, to their employees, other agencies, and the public. To access an application, users may need to provide identity information, create an account, and log in. These actions are part of the digital identity and authentication process. 

DIRAs determine the assurance levels for the digital transactions that involve digital identity or require human authentication.  When agencies build or buy applications that use the most current identity proofing and authentication standards, they protect both the digital transactions and the user and agency data behind the applications.

This Digital Identity Risk Assessment playbook helps federal agency Chief Information Officer (CIO) and Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) teams and business application owners to:

-	Update and maintain consistent processes;
-	Determine whether an agency application requires a DIRA;
-	Integrate DIRA into agency Risk Management Framework (RMF) processes; and
-	Learn practices to implement DIRA processes.

NIST publishes implementation guides (for more information, refer to [_NIST Special Publication 800-63-3: Digital Identity Guidelines_](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}) and frequently asked questions (FAQs) (NIST Special Publication 800-63-3: Digital Identity Guidelines Frequently Asked Questions)  for agencies and service providers to use to create information technology solutions to meet these standards. This playbook promotes consistency, effectiveness, and efficiency in your agency’s processes.
