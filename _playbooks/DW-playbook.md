**Table 11. Factor 4 Criteria Details**

| Criteria | Details | Score |
| ----------- | ---------------------- | --------------------- | 
| **4a)** Output impacts general internal business operations, but not for critical processes or decisions | The output of the digital worker is used solely for and/or may impact internal organizational business processes, operations, and decisions. However, the output isn’t used in critical organizational processes; if it is, then this would fall under criterion 4c.| 5 |
| **4b)** Output impacts outside organizations in general business operations or public reporting, but not for critical processes or decisions | The output of the digital worker is used for and/or may impact external organizational business processes, operations, and decisions. Additionally, the output may be used in public reporting GAO audits. However, the output shouldn’t be used in critical organizational processes; if it is, then this would fall under criterion 4c. | 25 |
| **4c)** Output impacts mission critical organization operations of the agency or other organizations, health or safety of individuals, national economic stability, national security, critical infrastructure, or similarly consequential operations | The output of the digital worker is used for and/or may impact mission critical operations of an organization, health and safety of individuals, national economic stability, national security, critical national infrastructure, or other similarly consequential operations. <br><br> This is a “trigger” criterion, meaning if the digital worker meets this criteria, it automatically should be in a Critical potential adverse impact level according to the scale in Table 1. | 90 |
