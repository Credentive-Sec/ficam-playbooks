[trying out DW md tables here as I build them]

**Table 6. Identity Management System (IDMS) Data Fields (DF)**

| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ID&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | IDMS Field Name | Field Type | Additional Guidance |
| ----------- | ------------ | ----------- | ------------ | 
| DF-1 | **Digital Worker**<br>_(new field)_ | Boolean<br>_e.g., Checkbox, True/False, yes/no, etc._ | _Denote if this is (Yes/True) or is not (No/False) a digital worker._ |
| DF-2 | **Agency unique user ID**<br>_(existing field)_ | Text<br>_Recommend using “DW” or other uniqueness element followed by the identifier based on agency naming conventions._ | _Use a distinguishing and standard naming convention for digital workers. This isn’t a card holder unique identifier (CHUID) or related to PIV._ |
| DF-3 | **First Name** and **Last Name**<br>_(existing fields)_ | Text<br>_**First name:** group function<br>**Last name:** “DW” followed by a numerical value_ | _Use agency naming convention if IDMS requires first and last name. The first name field should be completed with the group function (e.g., Technology Division, CFO) and the last name field should be completed with “DW” followed by a numerical value corresponding with the sequential order in which the digital worker was built within the associated group function._ |
| DF-4 | **Digital Worker Sponsor Name**<br>_(new field[s])_ | Text<br>_Recommend the individual’s full name (generally first and last name)_ | _Specify the sponsor of the digital worker._ |
| DF-5 | **Digital Worker Custodian Name**<br>_(new field[s])_ | Text<br>_Recommend the individual’s full name (generally first and last name)_ | _Specify the custodian of the digital worker._ |
| DF-6 | **Digital Worker Description**<br>_(optional new field)_ | Text(250)<br>_Recommend including a brief description of the digital worker (e.g., the type of AI used, the purpose, and actions of the digital worker)_ | _Provide a short description of what the digital worker does and the type of digital technology used._ |
| DF-7 | **Responsible Organization**<br>_(optional new field)_ | Text<br>_Include the name of the organization according to the official agency organizational chart_ | _Specify the name of the responsible agency organization or group._ |


| Score each factor based on the most applicable scenario |     | 
| ------------------------ | ------------ | 
| **Factor 1 - Is the digital worker attended or unattended?** | **Score** | 
| ● Attended | 0 | 
| ● Unattended | 10 |
| **Factor 2 - What is the highest level of data access by the digital worker?** |     | 
| ● Data available to the public (either without a user account or with unvetted user account) | 0 | 
| ● Agency operational data, controlled unclassified information (CUI), or data on individuals in low volumes. Doesn’t contain personally identifiable information (PII) or personal health information (PHI). | 5 |
| ● PII and/or PHI | 55 | 
| ● Agency critical operational data or data that could impact life, health, or safety of individuals/systems relied upon for health and safety; or very high volumes of agency operational data | 90 |
| **Factor 3 - Does the digital worker have access to internal and/or external networks?** |     | 
| ● No internal intranet or external Internet connection | 0 | 
| ● Either internal intranet access only OR external Internet access (not both) | 5 |
| ● Internal and external network access (i.e., internet and intranet) | 10 | 
| **Factor 4 - What is the impact of the output generated by the digital worker?** |     | 
| ● Output impacts general internal business operations, but not for critical processes or decisions | 5 | 
| ● Output impacts outside organizations in general business operations or public reporting (e.g., public facing websites or chatbots), but not for critical processes or decisions | 25 |
| ● Output impacts mission critical organization operations of the agency or other organizations, health or safety of individuals, national economic stability, national security, critical infrastructure, or similarly consequential operations | 90 | 
| **Factor 5 - What type of system account privileges does the digital worker require?** |     | 
| ● No system accounts used | 0 | 
| ● Standard system account(s) (roles limited by the business function) | 10 |
| ● System admin account (privileged access) | 35 | 
| ● Multiple system admin accounts (multiple privileged access roles) | 40 |
| **Factor 6 - Does the digital worker act on its own insights?** |     | 
| ● Digital worker develops insights, but doesn’t take action on its insights | 0 | 
| ● Digital worker develops insights and acts on the insights after human review | 5 |
| ● Digital worker develops insights and acts on the insights without human review or approval before the action is taken | 10 |
