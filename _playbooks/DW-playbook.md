**Table 12. Factor 5 Criteria Details**

| Criteria | Details | Score |
| ----------- | ---------------------- | --------------------- | 
| **5a)** No system accounts used | The digital worker doesn’t have any system accounts that are used to access databases, web applications, etc.| 0 |
| **5b)** Standard system account(s) (Roles limited by the business function) | The digital worker uses one or more system accounts that have a login (e.g., username, password, multi-factor authentication) to access databases, web applications, etc. The user privileges within the system account(s) are standard business user roles and have no system administrator privileges. The standard user roles are defined by the agencies and may include any combination of the following: read, write, execute, and delete. | 10 |
| **5c)** System admin account (privileged access) | The technology uses one or more system accounts that have a login (e.g., username, password, multi-factor authentication) to access databases, web applications, etc. Select this criterion if the digital worker will, or may need to have, access to systems or web applications with admin or otherwise, privileged access. If there are multiple system or web application accounts used by a technology, then only one may be admin or privileged access, as defined by the agency, and may include any combination of the following: read, write, execute, and delete.<br><br> This is a “trigger” criterion, meaning if the digital worker meets this criterion, it automatically should be in at least a Moderate potential adverse impact level according to the scale in Table 1.| 35 |
| **5d)** Multiple system admin accounts (multiple privileged access roles) | The digital worker uses one or more system accounts that have a login (e.g., username, password, multi-factor authentication) to access databases, web applications, etc. Select this criterion if the digital worker will, or may need to have, access to systems or web applications with admin or some sort of privileged access. Additionally, select this criterion if the digital worker requires, or may in the future require, admin or privileged access to multiple systems or web applications, as defined by the agency, and may include any combination of the following: read, write, execute, and delete.<br><br>This is a “trigger” criterion, meaning if the digital worker meets this criterion, it automatically should be in at least a Moderate potential adverse impact level according to the scale in Table 1. | 40 |
