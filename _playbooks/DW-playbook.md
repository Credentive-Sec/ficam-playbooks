***Table 2. Potential Adverse Impact Levels** 
| Impact Score | Potential Adverse Impact | Description |
| ------------------------ | ------------ | ------------------ |

| 36-55 | **Moderate** | Effects of an error or accident are limited and may result in minor or temporary impact on organizational missions/business functions, organizational assets, or the nation. This includes increased difficulty in performing business operations in a timely manner, with sufficient confidence, or within planned resource constraints; minor damage to agency image, reputation, or trust; minor financial loss to the agency or other organizations; and/or noncompliance with applicable laws or regulations. |
| 56-90 | **High** | Effects of an error or accident are wide-ranging and could result in serious or long-term impact on organizational missions/business functions, organizational assets, or the nation. This includes significant financial losses for the agency; substantially reduced capacity to conduct mission critical business; loss of PII, Business Identifiable Information, or PHI; and/or damage to agency image or reputation. |
| 91+ | **Critical** | Effects of an error or accident are extensive and will have severe or catastrophic impact on organizational missions/business functions, assets, or the nation.
