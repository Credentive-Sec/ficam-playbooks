[trying out DW md tables here as I build them]


**Table 13. Factor 6 Criteria Details**

| Criteria | Details | Score |
| ----------- | ---------------------- | --------------------- | 
| **6a)** Digital worker develops insights, but does not take action on its insights | The digital worker develops insights but doesn’t take separate action based on the insights. (e.g., a digital worker is used to diagnose a patient based on medical history data fed to a machine learning algorithm, then the digital worker only provides a diagnosis recommendation and doesn’t take any additional actions.) | 0 |
| **6b)** Digital worker develops insights and acts on the insights after human review | The digital worker is used first to develop insights. A human then reviews the insight and either edits or approves the insight. (e.g., a digital worker is used to diagnose a patient based on medical history data, then the tool will use the data to develop a diagnosis and recommended treatment [insight]. The doctor will review the diagnosis and recommended treatment. If the doctor disagrees with the insight, they will amend it; if the doctor agrees, they will approve it. Then, the digital worker administers the treatment to the patient.) | 5 |
| **6c)** Digital worker develops insight and acts on the insights without human review or approval before the action is taken | The tool develops insights and then uses the insight to determine a course of action. The tool proceeds with this action without human review of the initial insight. (e.g., a digital worker recommends a diagnosis and treatment based on data from the patient’s medical history. The digital worker acts on this recommendation by administering treatment to the patient without a doctor’s intermediary review.) | 10 |
