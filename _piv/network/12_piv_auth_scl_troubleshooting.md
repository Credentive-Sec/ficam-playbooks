| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | 
| **Card Selection and Pin Entry â€“ Symptom** | Smart card icon is not displayed; user is not prompted for PIN. |
| **Possible Cause 1** | Windows does not detect either the reader or the card due to a software or hardware issue with the card reader. |
| **Steps to Diagnose Cause 1** | 1. Ask the user to make sure that the PIV card is fully inserted in the reader.<br>2. If the smart card reader is an external USB device, ask the user to remove the device and try inserting it into a different USB port.<br>3. Ask the user to try rebooting their workstation.<br>4. Ask the user to try using their PIV with their PIN elsewhere.<br>5. If the issue persists through reboot, and the PIV with PIN works elsewhere, the smart card reader may need to be replaced or the workstation may need to be serviced. |
| **Steps to Resolve Cause 1** | Replace the smart card reader if it is an external device. Otherwise, schedule workstation repair. |
| **Possible Cause 2** | The PIV is damaged. |
| **Steps to Diagnose Cause 2** | If faulty workstation hardware or software is ruled out, and the card does not work on other readers, the PIV will need to be replaced. |
| **Steps to Resolve Cause 2** | Replace the PIV card. |
