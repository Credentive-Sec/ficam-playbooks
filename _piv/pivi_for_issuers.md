# Executive Summary

Federal agencies are interested in issuing and acquiring identity credentials and credential services that are not Personal Identity Verification (PIV) credentials, but are (a) technically interoperable with Federal Government PIV infrastructure, and (b) issued in a manner that allows Federal Government relying parties to trust the credentials. The PIV credential standard, Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) 201-2, has requirements[^1] that only federal agencies can meet to issue PIV credentials, requiring needed guidance for Issuers of PIV- Interoperable credentials. Prior guidance for the issuance of PIV-Interoperable credentials neglected to address the issuance of PIV-Interoperable credentials by federal agencies, requiring additional guidance for all issuers.

This document provides the guidance needed to assist both Federal Issuers and Non-Federal Issuers (NFI) of PIV-Interoperable (PIV-I) identity credentials in achieving credential
interoperability with the Federal Government PIV infrastructure. This document’s scope is limited to the issuance of PIV-Interoperable credentials; federal departments and agencies must continue to make their own authorization determination to allow or deny access when a PIV-Interoperable credential is used for authentication.

This document advocates a set of minimum requirements for PIV-Interoperable credentials that can be trusted by the Federal Government, and details solutions to the four barriers to interoperability that currently challenge Federal government. These four barriers are as follows:
1. **Common terminology for identity credentials and issuers** – To ensure consistency, a lexicon for differentiating a PIV credential from a credential interoperable with PIV infrastructure, and the differences between Non-Federal and Federal Issuers, has been developed.
2. **Assured identity** – The fundamental purpose of an identity credential is to establish the identity of the credential holder. Therefore, an identity credential must be issued in a federated model and consistent manner which provides the Federal Government with a requisite level of identity assurance.
3. **Technical requirements** – For identity credentials to be interoperable with the federal PIV infrastructure, basic technological requirements must be met.
4. **Security and auditing** – The boundaries for auditing and compliance requirements require clarification for federal agencies.

# 1. Introduction
## 1.1 Background

The Federal Government’s reliance (trust) on PIV credentials establishes a baseline for identity assurance, authenticator assurance, and suitability assurance. Federal agencies and issuers of identity credentials have expressed a desire to produce identity credentials that can be interoperable with Federal Government Personal Identity Verification (PIV) infrastructure and could be trusted by the Federal Government for use in authenticating to facilities, networks, and systems.

A definition for a PIV-Interoperable credential for federal agencies is required to address:
