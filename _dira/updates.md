In June 2017, NIST replaced Special Publication 800-63-2: Electronic Authentication Guideline with Special Publication 800-63-3: Digital Identity Guidelines. The new standard provides agencies with increased security and privacy, more flexibility to meet their mission and constituent needs, and better alignment with digital identity best practices. It outlines the digital identity risk assessment methodology that federal agencies must implement. 

NIST’s Digital Identity Guidelines identify the implementation requirements for conducting a DIRA and enable modernized risk-driven approaches for digital identities. Figure 12 depicts updated content details.

## Why Was the SP Updated?

NIST Special Publication 800-63-3 was updated to do the following: 
-	Implement Executive Order 13681: Improving the Security of Consumer Financial Transactions. 
-	Align with the current market
-	Promote innovation
-	Simplify and provide clearer guidance

## What Has Changed?

-	The DIRA process replaces the Electronic Authentication Risk Assessment process. 
-	There is a shift from levels of assurance (LOAs) to individual assurance levels (collectively known as xALs) for identity proofing, authentication, and federation.
-	The updated document introduces federation as a separate topic.

## Mix and Match Assurance Levels

The revised guidance provides individual assurance levels that can be mixed and matched, giving agencies the flexibility to deploy strong authentication without having to proof a user’s identity (i.e., if the collection of sensitive information is not required). The mix and match assurance levels allow opportunities for:
-	Greater flexibility, 
-	Greater user experience, 
-	Enhanced privacy, and 
-	Reduced risk.
