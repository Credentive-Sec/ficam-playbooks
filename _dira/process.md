The DIRA process begins when a new application or system is identified or a time-driven or event-driven reassessment is triggered. Once it is determined that a DIRA is needed, application data is identified, collected, and analyzed to determine the assurance levels, and produce a Digital Identity Assessment Statement (DIAS), as shown in Figure 1.

[![This is a circle figure with five steps. The DIRA process starts at the top of the circle when a new application or system is identified or when a time or event-based reassessment is triggered. Step 1 is Identify User, Transactions, and Roles. Step 2 is Identify Risks and Assurance Levels. Step 3 is Determine Steps to Meet Assurance Levels. Step 4 is Finalize Digital Identify  Assessment Statement. Step 5 is Reassess.
